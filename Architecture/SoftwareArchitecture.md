There are 2 common ways to architect the software product.
# [[Monolith]]
A monolithic architecture is characterized by having **all components of an application tightly integrated into a single codebase** and deployed as a single unit. 
#### Advantages 
- Simplicity in development and deployment 
- Easier to debug and test locally 
- No network latency between components 

#### Disadvantages 
- Scaling can be challenging 
- More difficult to adopt new technologies 
- Risk of the entire system failing if one part crashes

# [[Microservice]]
A microservices architecture breaks down an application into smaller, loosely coupled services, each running in its process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often through APIs.
#### Advantages
- Scalability: Individual components can be scaled independently
- Flexibility: Easier to adopt new technologies for different services
- Resilience: Failure of one service doesn't necessarily bring down the entire system

#### Disadvantages
- Increased complexity in development and deployment
- Challenges in managing inter-service communication and data consistency
- Requires additional overhead for monitoring and managing multiple services


## How to Choose Between Monolith and Microservices

When deciding between a monolithic or microservices architecture for your application, consider the following factors:

#### 1. Complexity of the Application

- **Monolith**: Suitable for simpler applications with fewer components and straightforward business logic.
- **Microservices**: Preferable for complex applications with multiple distinct functionalities that can be divided into independent services.

#### 2. Scalability Requirements

- **Monolith**: May struggle with scaling as the entire application needs to be replicated.
- **Microservices**: Provides better scalability as individual services can be scaled independently based on demand.

#### 3. Development Team Experience and Skillset

- **Monolith**: Requires a team with expertise in a specific technology stack since all components are tightly integrated.
- **Microservices**: Allows for flexibility in technology choices, suitable for teams with diverse skill sets or when adopting new technologies.

#### 4. Deployment and Operations Overhead

- **Monolith**: Simpler to deploy and manage as it involves a single codebase and deployment unit.
- **Microservices**: More complex deployment and operational overhead due to managing multiple services and inter-service communication.

#### 5. Fault Isolation and Resilience

- **Monolith**: Risk of the entire system failing if one component encounters an issue.
- **Microservices**: Provides better fault isolation as failures in one service do not necessarily impact the entire system.

#### 6. Future Growth and Maintenance

- **Monolith**: May become unwieldy and difficult to maintain as the application grows in size and complexity.
- **Microservices**: Offers better maintainability and agility, allowing for easier updates and enhancements as the application evolves.

Consider these factors carefully to make an informed decision based on your specific requirements, team capabilities, and long-term goals.
