A monolithic architecture is a traditional approach where all components of an application are tightly integrated into a single codebase and deployed as a single unit.

## Characteristics

- **Single Codebase**: The entire application is developed, built, and deployed as a single codebase.
- **Tight Coupling**: Components are tightly coupled, often sharing libraries and resources.
- **Single Deployment Unit**: Changes to any part of the application require deploying the entire monolith.
- **Shared Database**: Typically, a monolithic application uses a single database for all its functionalities.

## Advantages

- Simplicity in Development and Deployment
- Easier to Debug and Test Locally
- No Network Latency Between Components

## Disadvantages

- Scaling Challenges
- Difficulty in Adopting New Technologies
- Risk of Entire System Failure if One Part Crashes

## Best Use Cases

- Simple Applications with Limited Functionality
- Projects with Small Development Teams
- Rapid Prototyping and MVP Development
